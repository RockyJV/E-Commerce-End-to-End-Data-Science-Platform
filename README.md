## 📦 E-Commerce Analytics Platform

📅 Date: August 17, 2023 → December 8, 2023

### Overview
This project focused on designing and implementing an end-to-end data science platform for an e-commerce business, enabling sales and customer analytics. The platform was built on MariaDB hosted on AWS EC2, with optimizations for database performance, scalability, and analytical capabilities. The system was later extended by migrating to MongoDB for customer-centric analytics and building a machine learning model for customer segmentation.

### What I Did
✅ **Database Design & Optimization**

- Implemented MariaDB on AWS EC2, designing relational database schemas for e-commerce transactions, customers, and products.
- Optimized query performance using ETL processes, views, indexing strategies, stored procedures, and triggers to ensure efficient data retrieval and processing.

✅ **Data Migration & NoSQL Integration**

- Migrated customer data from MariaDB to MongoDB to enable flexible and scalable customer behavior analysis.
- Leveraged polyglot persistence, combining SQL (transactional) and NoSQL (customer analytics) databases for enhanced data-driven decision-making.

✅ **Business Intelligence & Visualization**

- Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze sales trends, customer purchase behavior, and coupon effectiveness.
- Enabled real-time insights for business stakeholders, improving data accessibility and decision-making.

✅ **Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation**

- Built a K-Means clustering model to segment customers based on purchase history and behavioral patterns.
- Enabled targeted marketing campaigns and personalized sales strategies by categorizing customers into distinct behavioral groups.
